Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle

So Object[] haystack1 = {"3", "123124234", null, "needle", "world", "hay", 2, "3", true, false};

should return 3;
